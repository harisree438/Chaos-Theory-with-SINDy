  Define parameters:  regularization parameter (Œª), time step (dt), and maximum time (t_max).
  Extract individual components (x, y, z) from the loaded data.
  Compute derivatives (dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt) using numerical gradients.

2. Construct Theta matrix :
  Build the design matrix (Theta(X)) incorporating constants, individual variables, products, squared terms, and trigonometric functions.

                              Œò(X) = [1.. X,X^2,X^3...   sin(X)   cos(X)   ...]
